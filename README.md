# gene-family-project

This repo contains all scripts (mostly R) I used to perform analyses for my project characterizing gene family evolution in the fungal plant pathogens <em>Calonectria henricotiae</em> and <em>C. pseudonaviculata</em>. The plots I generated for the preparation of my manuscript are also contained here.
